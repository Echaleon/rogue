A completely playable dungeon... mostly. The player character does not move, because it's pointless for next week in 1.05.
That being said, the code exists for the player to run, as there exists the ability to generate reverse Dijkstra mappings.
This will be useful for fleeing mosters later.

The make file is new and heavily updated to be much better, doing out of tree builds and having multiple targets.

The bulk of the code this week is in character.c, where the movement functions are, and in the new dungeon.c.

Dungeon generation was split from actual playing of the dungeons, so play_dungeon() contains the routines to actually do
so.

White space = Rocks
Grey space = Corridor
Black space = Room

< = Up Stair
> = Down Stair

Code has been ran through valgrind to find any memory leaks: none were found.
See comments in code for additional documentation. It's heavily heavily commented.
